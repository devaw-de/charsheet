    <div class="question">Something isn't working right. Can you fix it?</div>
    <div class="answer">
      I'll try. Please report any bugs using the <a routerLink="/feedback">feedback page</a>.<br>

    <div class="question">What kind of devices can I use?</div>
    <div class="answer">
      Any reasonably recent device of a certain size. Tablets and desktop computers just have more pixels than most phones.
      Browsers that should work best are Firefox and Chrome.
      <br>
      When in doubt, give it a try.

    <div class="question">I don't like how this looks. Can change some things around?</div>

      Probably not, sorry. It's a time issue.<br>

    <div class="question">Some features are missing.</div>
    <div class="answer">That's not a question.</div>

  <div class="faq-item section">
    <div class="question">Are you gonna add missing features?.</div>
    <div class="answer">
      Possibly. If the required time can be found. Some features might never make it into the app though.<br>
      Things that probably will not make it anytime soon include:
      <ul>
        <li>multi-classing</li>
        <li>player races and player classes that are not part of the PHB</li>
        <li>multi</li>
      </ul>
      Further up the priority list are things like:
      <ul>
        <li>more layouts and designs</li>
        <li>making parts of the character sheet optional or adjustable</li>
      </ul>

    <div class="question">What does "Save Character" actually do? What about "Clear local data"?</div>
    <div class="answer">
      Clicking the "Save Character" button will save the character
    </div>

  <div class="faq-item section">
    <div class="question">Cookies, huh?</div>
    <div class="answer">
      This app uses no cookies, no adds, and no trackers of any kind.<br>
      When you use the save character feature, a small amount of information will be saved on your device.<br>
      This enables the app to restore your changes when you visit again.<br>
      While this data can theoretically be used to check whether you have been on this page before, it is not being
      sent anywhere at any time.<br>
      You can delete this piece of information with the "clear local data" button at the bottom of the character sheet.
      Some devices will clear this data automatically after a certain time. If you want to ensure your changes will
      not be lost, please use the "export character" feature.
